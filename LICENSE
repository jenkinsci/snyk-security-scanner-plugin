ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT LICENSING

Certain files distributed by Snyk Ltd and/or its affiliates are
subject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPLv2,
based on the GNU Project exception for its Classpath libraries, known as the
GNU Classpath Exception.

Note that Snyk includes multiple, independent programs in this software
package.  Some of those programs are provided under licenses deemed
incompatible with the GPLv2 by the Free Software Foundation and others.
For example, the package includes programs licensed under the Apache
License, Version 2.0 and may include FreeType. Such programs are licensed
to you under their original licenses.

Snyk facilitates your further distribution of this package by adding the
Classpath Exception to the necessary parts of its GPLv2 code, which permits
you to use that code in combination with other independent modules not
licensed under the GPLv2. However, note that this would not permit you to
commingle code under an incompatible license with Snyk's GPLv2 licensed
code by, for example, cutting and pasting such code into a file also
containing Snyk's GPLv2 licensed code and then distributing the result.

Additionally, if you were to remove the Classpath Exception from any of the
files to which it applies and distribute the result, you would likely be
required to license some or all of the other code in that distribution under
the GPLv2 as well, and since the GPLv2 is incompatible with the license terms
of some items included in the distribution by Snyk, removing the Classpath
Exception could therefore effectively compromise your ability to further
distribute the package.

Failing to distribute notices associated with some files may also create
unexpected legal consequences.

Proceed with caution and we recommend that you obtain the advice of a lawyer
skilled in open source matters before removing the Classpath Exception or
making modifications to this package which may subsequently be redistributed
and/or involve the use of third party software.
